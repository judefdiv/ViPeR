# [NOTES]
# ALL MEASUREMENTS are in um.
# Pin location is at the CENTRE of the port.
# Routing connection to the pin must be a PTL on layer M3 with M2 and M4 as shielding groundplanes.
# The biasing pillars are on layer M5.
# Pillars are considered as obstructions.
# The the names for the gates in the .genlib file must match the gates of the gates in the runParameter.toml(this) file
